    <h1>AUTHENTIC FILIPINO LUMPIA</h1>
    <h2>Recipe by: Marlynn Jayme Schotland</h2>
    <p>
      I chose this Filipino recipe becasue Lumppia is the all time favorite of
      Filipinos and not only that this food is the go-to "handa" of every
      Filipino household when there is a party.
    </p>
    <h3>Steps on how to make an AUTHENTIC FILIPINO LUMPIA:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Make the filling</li>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You start by chopping the vegetables: garlic, onions, potatoes,
          carrots, celery, green beens, cabbage.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once all of the veggies are chopped and prepped, add vegetable oil or
          olive oil to a large stockpot or large skillet and heat over medium
          heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the oil is hot, add the garlic and onions and sauté 2 to 3
          minutes, just until the onions and garlic are soft and translucent.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the garlic and onions are translucent, add the ground beef,
          ground pork, salt, pepper, soy sauce, and sauté until the beef is
          browned.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drain the excess oil from the pan, add chicken broth and bring to
          boil. Add the potatoes and carrots, Salt, and simmer for 5-10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then, add the green beans, cabbage, and celery and simmer for another
          5 minutes. The vegetables should be slightly crisp.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <li>Assemble the Lumpia</li>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Now it's time to assemble these beautiful Filipino spring rolls.

Separate individual sheets of Lumpia wrappers very carefully, so as not to tear them. 
          </br> 
Do not allow them to dry out and become brittle, or you will be dealing with sad broken wrappers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place 1 heaping tablespoonful of the filling diagonally near one corner of the wrapper,
             leaving a 1.5 inch edge of space at both ends.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you find that the lumpia can use more filling, go ahead and add more to each lumpia. Just be careful not to overfill the lumpia. 
            <br>
            Too much filling can cause the wrappers to tear before or during frying.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fold the corner along the length of the filling over the filling, tuck in both ends so that
            <br>
             it almost looks like an envelope, and roll neatly and tight. Moisten the other side of the wrapper with water to seal the edge.


          </li>
          <li>
            The egg rolls can be fried immediately or frozen for later use.
          </li>
          <li>
            If frying them immediately, cover them with plastic wrap or a moist towel
             to keep the wrappers from drying out while you are frying the rest.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <li>Frying Fresh Lumpia</li>
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Heat a skillet over medium heat, add vegetable oil to about 1 inch depth, 
          <br>
          and heat for 5 minutes. Once the oil is hot, fry the egg rolls for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until all sides are golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may need to work in batches so as not to crowd the pan. Place on paper towels to drain excess oil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enjoy your AUTHENTIC FILIPINO LUMPIA
